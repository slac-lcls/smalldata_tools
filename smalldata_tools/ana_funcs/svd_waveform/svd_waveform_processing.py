General linear algebra comments on subspace projection:
If A = [u_1, ... , u_k] is an orthonormal basis of a subspace U (basis column vector arranged in a matrix), then
the projector is given by P = A(A.T). If the basis A is not orthonormal (as in the case of two-pulse basis 
for example), then the projector is P = A(A.TA)^-1 A.T = A pinv(A).

In this code, the exact definition and nomenclature are not always respected, in order to facilitate computation.
The projector is defined as A.T (or pinv A).
The relation Ax = (x.TA.T).T is also used to flip the matrix multiplication for the same reason.
